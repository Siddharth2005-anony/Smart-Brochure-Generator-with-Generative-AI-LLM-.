My project focused on developing a highly efficient and context-aware chatbot to deliver superior results compared to standard large language models. I architected the solution by integrating Gradio for a minimalist user interface and utilizing BeautifulSoup to perform real-time extraction and cleaning of relevant web content. This refined, domain-specific information was then fed directly to the Perplexity API's 'sonar' model as a detailed context prompt. This deliberate, integrated action, which also included robust error handling, led to a clear result: the content generated was significantly more informative and insightful than answers derived from simple direct prompts, successfully demonstrating a reliable and effective architecture for a content-aware LLM application.
